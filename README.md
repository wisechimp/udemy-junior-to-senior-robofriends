# Robofriends

This app is created in the React & Redux & Webpack portion of The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap course which is hosted by [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap/).

The redux version of the app is hosted on github pages [here](https://wisechimp.github.io/udemy-junior-to-senior-robofriends).

# N.B.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which I'm sure you could have worked out, you seem like a pretty smart cookie.
